The main algorithm is `DADMM_Partial.m`.

All code is implemented in Matlab. Although all algorithms are 
distributed, the code is centralized and runs sequentially. The purpose is to 
simulate distributed algorithms.

## Organization

* `DADMM_Partial.m`:
	solves the optimization problem

	\begin{equation}\label{Eq:SeparableOptim}
		\underset{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}{\text{minimize}} \,\,\, f_1(x) + f_2(x) + \cdots + f_P(x)\,,
	\end{equation}

	where the optimization variable has $n$ components $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, and
	each set $S_p$ indexes the components of $x$ that node $p$ depends on. See the 
	documentation in `DADMM_Partial`, and also the above paper [1] for terminology.

* UsageExamples: simple examples illustrating how to use `DAMM_Partial.m`. 

* CompareAlgs: 
  reproduces Figures 4 and 5 in the paper.

	
* GenerateData: contains data used in the experiments and also contains code
				  to generate other types of data. Some data is generated in Python/Sage.

* KekatosADMM: our implementation of the algorithm in

  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0991) 

  Note that the algorithm proposed in this paper was designed to solve (1) with
  a star-shaped variable, but we generalized it to operate with any connected
  variable.


* SpecialPurposeAlgs: 
  our implementation of the algorithms in the references below, which solve (1)
  only in the case of a star-shaped variable.
