The script in RunExperiments_NF2000.m reproduces Figure 4 in the paper

J. Mota, J. Xavier, P. Aguiar, M. PÃ¼schel,
Distributed Optimization With Local Domains: Applications in MPC and Network 
Flows, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2015

Please note that it might take a long time to run. To execute the same script
on a smaller network (100 nodes), run RunExperiments_NF.m instead.
